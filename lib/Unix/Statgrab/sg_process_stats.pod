=head1 NAME

Unix::Statgrab::sg_process_stats - container for libstatgrab process statistics

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Unix::Statgrab::sg_process_stats> is a Perl package name providing
accessors to bundled libstatgrab L<sg_process_stats|http://www.i-scream.org/libstatgrab/docs/sg_get_process_stats.3.html> process statistics.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 nentries

Returns the number of entries in the container.

=head2 systime

Returns the seconds since Epoch (0:00:00 on January, 1st 1970) of the time measure the process statistics.

=head2 as_list

B<Deprecated> alias of L</fetchall_hash>

=head2 fetchall_hash

Returns all records from L<sg_process_stats|http://www.i-scream.org/libstatgrab/docs/sg_get_process_stats.3.html>
container as list of hash containing each datum name as key and the datum as value.

=head2 fetchall_array

Returns all records from L<sg_process_stats|http://www.i-scream.org/libstatgrab/docs/sg_get_process_stats.3.html>
container as list of arrays containing the values in following order:

  (process_name proctitle pid parent pgid sessid uid euid gid egid
   context_switches voluntary_context_switches involuntary_context_switches
   proc_size proc_resident start_time time_spent cpu_percent nice state
   systime)

in that order without leading headline.

=head2 fetchall_table

Returns all records from L<sg_process_stats|http://www.i-scream.org/libstatgrab/docs/sg_get_process_stats.3.html>
container as list of arrays containing the values in following order:

  (disk_name read_bytes write_bytes systime)

in that order including leading headline.

=head2 fetchrow_arrayref($row = 0)

Returns one row as array containing values as above.

=head2 fetchall_arrayref

Returns all records from L<sg_process_stats|http://www.i-scream.org/libstatgrab/docs/sg_get_process_stats.3.html>
container as array of arrays without header.

=head2 fetchrow_hashref($row = 0)

Returns one row as hash containing C<< { process_name => $self.process_name($row), proctitle => ... } >>.

=head2 fetchall_hashref

Returns all records from L<sg_process_stats|http://www.i-scream.org/libstatgrab/docs/sg_get_process_stats.3.html>
container as array of hashes.

=head2 colnames

Returns list of column names: C<< (process_name proctitle pid parent pgid sessid uid euid gid egid context_switches voluntary_context_switches involuntary_context_switches proc_size proc_resident start_time time_spent cpu_percent nice state systime) >>

=head2 process_name

The name of the command that was run. The content of this field heavily depends on the underlying operating system, some store the basename the executable passes to the exec(2) system call, some the entire path. Most OS restrict the size of this field - some like the *BSD family to a very low value of 15 bytes.

This field is usually immutable for userland processes. 

=head2 proctitle

The command line (the "title") of the process. Take note - this can be modified by the process, so isn't guaranteed to be the original command line.

=head2 pid

The process ID.

=head2 parent

The parent process ID.

=head2 pgid

The process ID of the process group leader.

=head2 sessid

Session id of the session the process belongs to.

=head2 uid

The ID of the user the process is running as.

=head2 euid

The ID of the effective user the process is running as.

=head2 gid

The ID of the group the process is running as.

=head2 egid

The ID of the effective group the process is running as. 

=head2 context_switches

The number of context switches of this process (voluntary and involuntary). 

=head2 voluntary_context_switches

The number of voluntary context switches of this process (e.g. by calling C<sched_yield()>, C<sleep()> or C<nanosleep()>). 

=head2 involuntary_context_switches

The number of involuntary context switches of this process (e.g. time slice exhausted or signal sent).

=head2 proc_size

The virtual memory size of the process in bytes.

=head2 proc_resident

The size of the process that's resident in memory.

=head2 start_time

The time when the process has been started in seconds since epoch.

=head2 time_spent

The number of seconds the process has been running (user+system time, without time spent by child processes).

=head2 cpu_percent

The current percentage of CPU the process is using.

=head2 nice

The nice value of the process.

=head2 state

The current state of the process, one of

    SG_PROCESS_STATE_RUNNING SG_PROCESS_STATE_SLEEPING SG_PROCESS_STATE_STOPPED
    SG_PROCESS_STATE_ZOMBIE SG_PROCESS_STATE_UNKNOWN
