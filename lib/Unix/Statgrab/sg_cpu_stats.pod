=head1 NAME

Unix::Statgrab::sg_cpu_stats - container for libstatgrab CPU statistics

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Unix::Statgrab::sg_cpu_stats> is a Perl package name providing

=head1 METHODS

=head2 nentries

Returns the number of entries in the container.

=head2 systime

Returns the seconds since Epoch (0:00:00 on January, 1st 1970) of the time measure the CPU statistics.

=head2 as_list

B<Deprecated> alias of L</fetchall_hash>

=head2 fetchall_hash

Returns all records from L<sg_cpu_stats|http://www.i-scream.org/libstatgrab/docs/sg_get_cpu_stats.3.html>
container as list of hash containing each datum name as key and the datum as value.

=head2 fetchall_array

Returns all records from L<sg_cpu_stats|http://www.i-scream.org/libstatgrab/docs/sg_get_cpu_stats.3.html>
container as list of arrays containing the values in following order:

  (user kernel idle iowait swap nice total
   context_switches voluntary_context_switches involuntary_context_switches
   syscalls interrupts soft_interrupts
   systime)

in that order without leading headline.

=head2 fetchall_table

Returns all records from L<sg_cpu_stats|http://www.i-scream.org/libstatgrab/docs/sg_get_cpu_stats.3.html>

   systime)

in that order including leading headline.

=head2 fetchrow_arrayref($row = 0)

=head2 fetchall_arrayref

Returns all records from L<sg_cpu_stats|http://www.i-scream.org/libstatgrab/docs/sg_get_cpu_stats.3.html>
container as array of arrays without header.

=head2 fetchrow_hashref($row = 0)

Returns one row as hash containing C<< { user => $self.user($row), kernel => ... } >>.

=head2 fetchall_hashref

Returns all records from L<sg_cpu_stats|http://www.i-scream.org/libstatgrab/docs/sg_get_cpu_stats.3.html>
